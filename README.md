<h1>Worldwise</h1>

The web app is a travel tracking and adventure registration application. Its main purpose is to allow users to register and keep track of the places they have traveled to, providing them with a visual representation of their adventures on a map. The app is built using React with the react-router-dom library for navigation and the context API for state management.


Key Features:

**Adventure Registration**: Users can fill out a form to register the cities they have visited. The form likely includes fields such as city name, date of visit, and any additional details they wish to provide.

**Map Visualization**: The app incorporates a map component that displays markers for each registered city the user has visited. Clicking on a marker provides more information about the city and the user's adventure there.

**React Router**: The react-router-dom library is utilized to enable navigation within the app. It allows users to move between different pages or views, such as the home page, the registration form, and the map view.

**Context API for State Management**: The context API is used to manage the state of the application. It allows for the sharing of data between different components without the need for prop drilling, making it easier to track and update the user's travel data.
